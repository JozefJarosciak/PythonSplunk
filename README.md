# How to query and visualize Apache logs in Splunk with Python

Splunk Enterprise is presumably one of the best platforms for gaining real-time intelligence from data. The following short tutorial explains how to install Splunk server (on Windows or Linux server) and how to use Python to programmatically query Splunk and visualize Apache data by plotting them on a graph by using the Matplotlib library. In this post, show step by step, how to add Apache logs to Splunk, and illustrate how relatively easy is to use Python to query how much bandwidth was consumed by one of my websites (in the past week, in megabytes).
